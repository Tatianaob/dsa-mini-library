## DSA Mini-Library:
 
A Python-based mini-library implementing core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) from scratch. Designed to reinforce Python fundamentals and prepare for coding interviews, this project includes clean, testable implementations of:

- Singly Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Search Tree
- Hash Map
- Graph (Adjacency List)

### Goals 
- Strengthen understanding of core data structures
- Practice writing clean, modular, and tested Python code
- Prepare for technical interviews 

### Tech Stack
- Python 3.9+
- Pytest for unit testing

### How to Run
- Install dependencies (if any)
- pip install -r requirements.txt

###  Run tests
- python -m pytest
