DSA Mini-Library
A Python-based mini-library implementing core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) from scratch. Designed to reinforce Python fundamentals and prepare for coding interviews, this project includes clean, testable implementations of:

Singly Linked List

Stack

Queue

Binary Search Tree

Hash Map

Graph (Adjacency List)

Each module includes unit tests to ensure correctness and encourage test-driven development.

ðŸ“š Goals
Strengthen understanding of core data structures

Practice writing clean, modular, and tested Python code

Prepare for technical interviews with hands-on examples

Populate GitHub with solid Python work

ðŸ§ª Tech Stack
Python 3.9+

Pytest for unit testing

Organized using standard Python package structure

ðŸš€ How to Run
# Install dependencies (if any)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
